# Our First Laravel Project : Shopping Directory Web
<p align="center"><img src="https://laravel.com/assets/img/components/logo-laravel.svg"></p>
<p align="center">This project is developed using Laravel Framework.</p>

## Overview of the project 
A mega shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur is planning to do away with the plastic boards mall directories placed at various zones in the mall. The frequent relocations and change of tenants have increased the cost of replacing the plastic boards to update the list of tenants. The management has proposed to replace the plastic boards with touch-screen electronic mall directory. Build a web application framework (Laravel) for the mall directory in this mega shopping mall.

# What Have we done ?
Let me summarise what we have done in this project :
- [x] Customers at the mall can browse the list of tenants; grouped by zones, floor levels and categories.
- [x] Selecting a tenant will display the name, lot number, zone, floor level and category of the tenant.
- [x] The management may perform create, update and delete tenants.
- [x] The management uses a single login username and password to access the back-end.
- [x] A database table named tenant with the required attributes must be used to store data about tenants.
- [x] Use of either session or cookie for user authentication at the back-end.
- [x] Client-side validation is required for the back-end interface to validate input.
